# RayPongC

A small pong game made with the awesome [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com). Just for fun, to make a pure C game.

## Status

Game is basically complete, you can follow progress and todos [here](https://github.com/XReaper95/RayPongC/projects/1),
I may implement everything there one day. Notice that collision with paddle is a little broken in the current build.

## Controls

Use SPACE to randomly throw the ball to any direction (limited by a small arc to each side). Use W and A keys to control
Player 1 and UP and DOWN to control Player 2. Game is goal is 5 points.
